# React drag and drop app
I made this to practice how to use firestore and drag and drop elements in react

## What exactly I'm using:
    React:
    - UseEffect to update my task list and render on table
    - UseState for adding new element

    FireBase:
    - firestore collections
    - documents for saving in data base
    - some methods of firebase to connect with firestore and adding and updating docs in the collection firestore
    
    Drag and drop element:
    - onDragStart, onDrop, onDragOver
    - transfer arguments between functions.

Need firebase datas* file
