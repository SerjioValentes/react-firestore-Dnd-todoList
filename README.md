# React drag and drop app
I'm maked this for training how to use firestore and drag and drop elements in react

## What exactly im used:
    React:
    - **UseEffect** for update my task list and render on table
    - **UseState** for add new element

    FireBase:
    - **firestore collections in doc** for save elements in data base
    - some **methods** of firebase **to connect with firestore** and **adding and updating docs** in the collection firestore
    
    Drag and drop element:
    - onDragStart, onDrop, onDragOver
    - transfer arguments between them.
